### Motivation

Our project focuses on understanding AED accessibility and traffic congestion in New York City. We were inspired by an interest in cardiovascular health, and decided to narrow in on AED accessibility after seeing the datasets that were available to us through NYC Open Data. Sudden cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for approximately 250,000 deaths each year. Survival can increase by 29% through bystander CPR and use of an AED, before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive at the scene. In comparison, survival with CPR alone is about 9%, while CPR combined with AED use and shock delivery increases survival to 38%. Because NYC is a dense and highly populated city with heavy traffic, delays in emergency response are a real concern. Quick access to an AED can make a major difference during a sudden cardiac arrest, especially when ambulances may be slowed down by congestion. By exploring AED locations, traffic patterns, and leading causes of death, we wanted to see whether AEDs are placed in areas where fast response is especially important.

### Inspiration

Many of us have taken CPR classes where AED use was explained. We were also aware of the strong public health emphasis that exists regarding CPR and AED training, and we wanted our final project to be focused on bettering health outcomes. AEDs are devices that community members can learn to use, and early CPR and defibrillation have been proven to greatly improve survival rates during cardiac emergencies. We were lucky enough to find datasets from NYC Open Data that made it possible to study AED placement, traffic patterns, and health outcomes across the city. This, along with our prior experiences, encouraged us to look at whether AEDs are placed in areas where people may need fast access, especially in a busy and high-traffic city like New York City. 


### Research questions

1. Which boroughs experience the highest traffic congestion?
2. How many AED-equipped sites are available in each borough?
3. Do boroughs with heavier traffic also have more AEDs?

### Data

We used three datasets from NYC Open Data:

 (1) the Leading Causes of Death (2021)
 (2) Automated Traffic Volume Counts for 2019–2024
 (3) the NYC AED Inventory
 
To prepare the data, we standardized variable names, removed missing coordinates from the AED dataset, converted numeric columns where needed, and filtered the traffic dataset to include only the years 2019–2024. After cleaning, we saved all three final datasets in a clean_data folder so that the rest of the analysis, mapping, and dashboard work could use the same consistent files.

### Exploratory analysis

In the exploratory stage, we looked at each dataset separately and then combined them at the borough level. From the Leading Causes of Death data, we found that diseases of the heart had the highest number of deaths in NYC in 2021 (over 16,500 deaths). This supports our focus on cardiac events and the importance of fast access to AEDs. For the traffic data, we summarized measurements from 2019–2024 by borough. Queens and Brooklyn had the largest number of measurements and monitored street segments, while Manhattan had the highest mean and median traffic volume, as well as the widest spread in volume. The overall distribution of traffic volume was right-skewed, with most counts below 100 and only a small proportion above 200. When we looked at trends over time, all boroughs showed a clear drop in 2020, likely related to COVID-19 restrictions, followed by recovery in later years. For the AED inventory, we summarized the number of AED-equipped sites and site-level characteristics by borough. Manhattan had the most AED locations, while the Bronx and Staten Island had the fewest. On average, AED sites had more than one device and several trained people, but the total number of sites was not equal across boroughs. Finally, we merged the traffic and AED summaries to compare them directly. Brooklyn and Queens had high traffic activity and many monitored segments, but fewer AED-equipped sites than Manhattan. Staten Island had low traffic and also low AED coverage. These patterns suggest that AED availability does not always increase in the same way as traffic burden. This motivated the next phase of our project, where we plan to study AED density, traffic burden, and their relationship using linear models, correlation, and a Traffic Burden Ratio.


### Formal statistical analysis

For our project, the formal statistical analyses we conducted included a linear regression model for both mean traffic volume across boroughs and mean AEDs across boroughs separately, a correlation between AED density and mean traffic volume, and lastly, a derived metric detailing the ratio of traffic burden. 

We decided to compute linear regression models to be able to identify which boroughs had the greatest/least traffic volume. We used Manhattan as the comparison group because we hypothesized they had the largest amount of traffic volume, due to its reputation of being a highly populated tourist area. After computing this, we computed a linear regression model to be able to compare AED density across boroughs, and again, we used Manhattan as a reference group to ensure consistency for our report. 

We conducted a Pearson correlation to assess the relationship between AED density and mean traffic volume, primarily to see if there was a trend. We hypothesized that boroughs with higher traffic volume would have lower AED density, which would indicate that AED distribution was not consistent with traffic volume.

Next, we computed the derived metric. We decided to compute this because we thought seeing the data relative to each other was important. This way, we were able to compare traffic volume to AED density directly in each borough to identify which boroughs may be in need of more AED access points to make the greatest impact in prevention of Sudden Cardiac Arrest.

### Discussion

Through our linear regression model for mean traffic volume across boroughs, we found that every borough had a mean traffic volume that was less than Manhattans. Specifically, the mean traffic volume in The Bronx was 61.1 cars less than that of Manhattan per intersection, Brooklyn was 24.9 cars less than that of Manhattan per intersection, Queens was 29.8 cars less than that of Manhattan per intersection, and lastly Staten Island was 38.6 cars less than that of Manhattan per intersection. On average, Manhattan had 147.6 cars worth of traffic volume at a given intersection. Since we hypothesized that the mean traffic volume was highest in Manhattan and chose Manhattan as our reference for that reason, this was what we generally expected. We were surprised to see that all other boroughs had similar numerical values of average traffic volume per intersection, except for The Bronx which had a lot less.

When computing our linear regression model for AED density across boroughs, we found that Manhattan also had the greatest AED density of all boroughs with a mean AED density of 1.795 AED access points per location. In comparison, The Bronx had .75 less AED access points per location, Brooklyn had .69 less AED access points per location, Queens had .32 less AED access points per location, and lastly Staten Island had .57 less AED access points per location. We were surprised to see that Manhattan had the greatest average number of AED access points per location. When we decided to conduct this analysis, we assumed Manhattan would have a lot of traffic and low access to AED, which would have detrimental impacts to the survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest. 

The correlational analysis resulted in a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.826, which indicates a strong positive relationship between mean traffic volume and AED densities. Boroughs with higher mean traffic volume have more available AEDs, as seen by Manhattan having a mean traffic volume of 147.6 and 6583 AEDs while the Bronx has a mean traffic volume of 86.53 with only 1030 available AEDs, in comparison. However, the corresponding p-value for this correlation is > 0.05. This means that while the relationship between AED density and traffic volume is strong, it is not statistically significant. The expectation was that areas with higher traffic volume would have lower AED density, but the high and positive correlation coefficient indicates otherwise. However, as it is a non-significant result, no reasonable conclusions can be made about the correlation; the correlation we see may be due to random chance rather than there being a true relationship between the two variables.

To get a better comparison of AED density relative to traffic volume, we did our next analysis of a traffic burden ratio. Manhattan had the highest traffic volume and also the highest AED density, so the traffic burden ratio was the smallest out of all boroughs at 1,973. In comparison, the traffic burden ratio for Bronx was 5,425, for Staten Island was 6,295, for Queens was 10,574, and for Brooklyn was 12,666. After doing the linear regression models to observe AED density and traffic volume separately, we expected Manhattan to have the smallest traffic burden ratio since the large number of AED access points mitigated the burden of high traffic volume. We were surprised to see that Brooklyn had an extremely large traffic burden ratio, almost 12 times higher than that of Manhattan, and that Queens had the second highest ratio. With this information, we can confidently say that measures should be taken to improve AED access in Brooklyn and Queens. As future public health workers, we have a goal of increasing health equity. In order to do so, it is important for us to ensure the traffic burden ratio in each borough of New York is small and similar to each other, as the ratio is a good indicator of AED accessibility relative to traffic volume.
