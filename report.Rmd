The written report produced by your team is central to this project. This will detail how you completed your project, and should cover data collection and cleaning, exploratory analyses, alternative strategies, descriptions of approaches, and a discussion of results. We anticipate that your project will change somewhat over time; these changes and the reasons for them should be documented! You will write one report document per group, and be sure to include all group member names in the document.

Your report should include the following topics. Depending on your project type the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:

### Motivation

Our project focuses on understanding AED accessibility and traffic congestion in New York City. Cardiovascular disease is not only the leading cause of death in the United States, but also the leading cause of death worldwide. Because NYC is a dense and highly populated city with heavy traffic, delays in emergency response are a real concern. Quick access to an AED can make a major difference during a sudden cardiac arrest, especially when ambulances may be slowed down by congestion. By exploring AED locations, traffic patterns, and leading causes of death, we wanted to see whether AEDs are placed in areas where fast response is especially important.

### Inspired source

We were inspired by the datasets available through NYC Open Data, which make it possible to study AED placement, traffic patterns, and health outcomes across the city. Another important influence is the strong public health emphasis on CPR and AED training. AEDs are devices that community members can learn to use, and early CPR and defibrillation are known to greatly improve survival during cardiac emergencies. These ideas encouraged us to look at whether AEDs are placed in areas where people may need fast access, especially in a busy and high-traffic city like New York city.


### Initial questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?

1. Which boroughs experience the highest traffic congestion?
2. How many AED-equipped sites are available in each borough?
3. Do boroughs with heavier traffic also have more AEDs?

### Data

We used three datasets from NYC Open Data:

 (1) the Leading Causes of Death (2021)
 (2) Automated Traffic Volume Counts for 2019–2024
 (3) the NYC AED Inventory
 
To prepare the data, we standardized variable names, removed missing coordinates from the AED dataset, converted numeric columns where needed, and filtered the traffic dataset to include only the years 2019–2024. After cleaning, we saved all three final datasets in a clean_data folder so that the rest of the analysis, mapping, and dashboard work could use the same consistent files.

### Exploratory analysis

In the exploratory stage, we looked at each dataset separately and then combined them at the borough level. From the Leading Causes of Death data, we found that diseases of the heart had the highest number of deaths in NYC in 2021 (over 16,500 deaths). This supports our focus on cardiac events and the importance of fast access to AEDs. For the traffic data, we summarized measurements from 2019–2024 by borough. Queens and Brooklyn had the largest number of measurements and monitored street segments, while Manhattan had the highest mean and median traffic volume, as well as the widest spread in volume. The overall distribution of traffic volume was right-skewed, with most counts below 100 and only a small proportion above 200. When we looked at trends over time, all boroughs showed a clear drop in 2020, likely related to COVID-19 restrictions, followed by recovery in later years. For the AED inventory, we summarized the number of AED-equipped sites and site-level characteristics by borough. Manhattan had the most AED locations, while the Bronx and Staten Island had the fewest. On average, AED sites had more than one device and several trained people, but the total number of sites was not equal across boroughs. Finally, we merged the traffic and AED summaries to compare them directly. Brooklyn and Queens had high traffic activity and many monitored segments, but fewer AED-equipped sites than Manhattan. Staten Island had low traffic and also low AED coverage. These patterns suggest that AED availability does not always increase in the same way as traffic burden. This motivated the next phase of our project, where we plan to study AED density, traffic burden, and their relationship using ANOVA, correlation, and a Traffic Burden Ratio.


### Additional analysis: If you undertake formal statistical analyses, describe these in detail

### Discussion: What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?

As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your report is a standalone document that fully describes your process and results. We also expect you to write high-quality code that is understandable to an outside reader. Coding collaboratively and actively reviewing code within the team will help with this!
