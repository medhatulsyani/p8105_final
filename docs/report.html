<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Our project focuses on understanding AED accessibility and traffic
congestion in New York City. We were inspired by an interest in
cardiovascular health, and decided to narrow in on AED accessibility
after seeing the datasets that were available to us through NYC Open
Data. Sudden cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death in the
United States, accounting for approximately 250,000 deaths each year.
Survival can increase by 29% through bystander CPR and use of an AED,
before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive at the scene. In
comparison, survival with CPR alone is about 9%, while CPR combined with
AED use and shock delivery increases survival to 38%. Because NYC is a
dense and highly populated city with heavy traffic, delays in emergency
response are a real concern. Quick access to an AED can make a major
difference during a sudden cardiac arrest, especially when ambulances
may be slowed down by congestion. By exploring AED locations, traffic
patterns, and leading causes of death, we wanted to see whether AEDs are
placed in areas where fast response is especially important.</p>
</div>
<div id="inspired-source" class="section level3">
<h3>Inspired source</h3>
<p>We were inspired by the available datasets from NYC Open Data, which
made it possible to study AED placement, traffic patterns, and health
outcomes across the city. We were also aware of the strong public health
emphasis that exists regarding CPR and AED training, and we wanted our
final project to be focused on bettering health outcomes. AEDs are
devices that community members can learn to use, and early CPR and
defibrillation have been proven to greatly improve survival rates during
cardiac emergencies. These ideas encouraged us to look at whether AEDs
are placed in areas where people may need fast access, especially in a
busy and high-traffic city like New York City.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Initial questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did
these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new
questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Which boroughs experience the highest traffic congestion?</li>
<li>How many AED-equipped sites are available in each borough?</li>
<li>Do boroughs with heavier traffic also have more AEDs?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>We used three datasets from NYC Open Data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the Leading Causes of Death (2021)</li>
<li>Automated Traffic Volume Counts for 2019–2024</li>
<li>the NYC AED Inventory</li>
</ol>
<p>To prepare the data, we standardized variable names, removed missing
coordinates from the AED dataset, converted numeric columns where
needed, and filtered the traffic dataset to include only the years
2019–2024. After cleaning, we saved all three final datasets in a
clean_data folder so that the rest of the analysis, mapping, and
dashboard work could use the same consistent files.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploratory analysis</h3>
<p>In the exploratory stage, we looked at each dataset separately and
then combined them at the borough level. From the Leading Causes of
Death data, we found that diseases of the heart had the highest number
of deaths in NYC in 2021 (over 16,500 deaths). This supports our focus
on cardiac events and the importance of fast access to AEDs. For the
traffic data, we summarized measurements from 2019–2024 by borough.
Queens and Brooklyn had the largest number of measurements and monitored
street segments, while Manhattan had the highest mean and median traffic
volume, as well as the widest spread in volume. The overall distribution
of traffic volume was right-skewed, with most counts below 100 and only
a small proportion above 200. When we looked at trends over time, all
boroughs showed a clear drop in 2020, likely related to COVID-19
restrictions, followed by recovery in later years. For the AED
inventory, we summarized the number of AED-equipped sites and site-level
characteristics by borough. Manhattan had the most AED locations, while
the Bronx and Staten Island had the fewest. On average, AED sites had
more than one device and several trained people, but the total number of
sites was not equal across boroughs. Finally, we merged the traffic and
AED summaries to compare them directly. Brooklyn and Queens had high
traffic activity and many monitored segments, but fewer AED-equipped
sites than Manhattan. Staten Island had low traffic and also low AED
coverage. These patterns suggest that AED availability does not always
increase in the same way as traffic burden. This motivated the next
phase of our project, where we plan to study AED density, traffic
burden, and their relationship using linear models, correlation, and a
Traffic Burden Ratio.</p>
</div>
<div id="formal-statistical-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Formal statistical analysis</h3>
<p>For our project, the formal statistical analyses we conducted
included a linear regression model for both mean traffic volume across
boroughs and mean AEDs across boroughs separately, a correlation between
AED density and mean traffic volume, and lastly, a derived metric
detailing the ratio of traffic burden.</p>
<p>We decided to compute linear regression models to be able to identify
which boroughs had the greatest/least traffic volume. We used Manhattan
as the comparison group because we hypothesized they had the largest
amount of traffic volume, due to its reputation of being a highly
populated tourist area. After computing this, we computed a linear
regression model to be able to compare AED density across boroughs, and
again, we used Manhattan as a reference group to ensure consistency for
our report.</p>
<p>We conducted a Pearson correlation to assess the relationship between
AED density and mean traffic volume, primarily to see if there was a
trend and to understand whether boroughs with higher traffic congestion
tend to have higher.</p>
<p>Next, we computed the derived metric. We decided to compute this
because we thought seeing the data relative to each other was important.
This way, we were able to compare traffic volume to AED density directly
in each borough to identify which boroughs may be in need of more AED
access points to make the greatest impact in prevention of Sudden
Cardiac Arrest.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Through our linear regression model for mean traffic volume across
boroughs, we found that every borough had a mean traffic volume that was
less than Manhattans. Specifically, the mean traffic volume in The Bronx
was 61.1 cars less than that of Manhattan per intersection, Brooklyn was
24.9 cars less than that of Manhattan per intersection, Queens was 29.8
cars less than that of Manhattan per intersection, and lastly Staten
Island was 38.6 cars less than that of Manhattan per intersection. On
average, Manhattan had 147.6 cars worth of traffic volume at a given
intersection. Since we hypothesized that the mean traffic volume was
highest in Manhattan and chose Manhattan as our reference for that
reason, this was what we generally expected. We were surprised to see
that all other boroughs had similar numerical values of average traffic
volume per intersection, except for The Bronx which had a lot less.</p>
<p>When computing our linear regression model for AED density across
boroughs, we found that Manhattan also had the greatest AED density of
all boroughs with a mean AED density of 1.795 AED access points per
location. In comparison, The Bronx had .75 less AED access points per
location, Brooklyn had .69 less AED access points per location, Queens
had .32 less AED access points per location, and lastly Staten Island
had .57 less AED access points per location. We were surprised to see
that Manhattan had the greatest average number of AED access points per
location. When we decided to conduct this analysis, we assumed Manhattan
would have a lot of traffic and low access to AED, which would have
detrimental impacts to the survival rates of Sudden Cardiac Arrest.</p>
<p>The correlational analysis resulted in a Pearson’s correlation
coefficient of 0.826, which indicates a strong positive relationship
between mean traffic volume and AED densities. Boroughs with higher mean
traffic volume have more available AEDs, as seen by Manhattan having a
mean traffic volume of 147.6 and 6583 AEDs while the Bronx has a mean
traffic volume of 86.53 with only 1030 available AEDs, in comparison.
However, the corresponding p-value for this correlation is &gt; 0.05.
This means that while the relationship between AED density and traffic
volume is strong, it is not statistically significant. The expectation
was that areas with higher traffic volume would have lower AED density,
but the high and positive correlation coefficient indicates otherwise.
However, as it is a non-significant result, no reasonable conclusions
can be made about the correlation; the correlation we see may be due to
random chance rather than there being a true relationship between the
two variables.</p>
<p>To get a better comparison of AED density relative to traffic volume,
we did our next analysis of a traffic burden ratio. Manhattan had the
highest traffic volume and also the highest AED density, so the traffic
burden ratio was the smallest out of all boroughs at 1,973. In
comparison, the traffic burden ratio for Bronx was 5,425, for Staten
Island was 6,295, for Queens was 10,574, and for Brooklyn was 12,666.
After doing the linear regression models to observe AED density and
traffic volume separately, we expected Manhattan to have the smallest
traffic burden ratio since the large number of AED access points
mitigated the burden of high traffic volume. We were surprised to see
that Brooklyn had an extremely large traffic burden ratio, almost 12
times higher than that of Manhattan, and that Queens had the second
highest ratio. With this information, we can confidently say that
measures should be taken to improve AED access in Brooklyn and Queens.
As future public health workers, we have a goal of increasing health
equity. In order to do so, it is important for us to ensure the traffic
burden ratio in each borough of New York is small and similar to each
other, as the ratio is a good indicator of AED accessibility relative to
traffic volume.</p>
