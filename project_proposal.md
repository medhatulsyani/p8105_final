## Project Title

AED Accessibility and Traffic Congestion in New York City

## Motivation for the project

Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are commonly used in
combination with CPR to create what the American Heart Association
describes as the “Chain of Survival” in individuals undergoing sudden
cardiac arrest (Page, 2011). Although AED accessibility is an integral
part of increasing the chances of survival, the constant traffic
congestion in New York City creates a disadvantage for residents with
the time it takes healthcare workers to travel to the scene.

Our motivation for this project is to understand how AED accessibility
corresponds with traffic congestion in New York City. Through a
combination of data on AED locations, traffic volume, and cardiovascular
disease, we hope to identify potential gaps in AED coverage in
high-traffic areas. Additionally, it may useful to analyze current data
to understand how the recently introduced congestion pricing may affect
AED accessibility/EMS response, and to examine differences between
traffic volume pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and post-pandemic and
how this corresponds with AED accessibility.

## The intended final products

This project will include **three final deliverable**: EDA to summarize
**AED distribution and traffic volume trends** across boroughs from 2019
to 2024, **Inferential analysis** using ANOVA and correlation to compare
AED and traffic measures across boroughs and over time, and
**Dashboard** displaying AED locations, borough-level summaries, and
traffic trends

## The anticipated data sources (NYC Opendata)

**1. NYC Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Inventory** Lists
registered AED locations in public facilities across NYC (DOHMH)

**2. Automated Traffic Volume Counts (2019–2024)** Lists vehicle counts
by intersection, year, and borough (DOT)

**3. NYC Leading Causes of Death (through 2021)** Annual cause-specific
mortality data aggregated citywide (DOHMH)

## Coding Challenges

We anticipate that some AED location data will be missing or have
inaccurate coordinates. Furthermore, matching the specific point AED
locations to traffic intersections which cover a larger area will be a
challenge. When creating a dashboard with a large set of AED locations
and traffic intersections can lead to lazy loading. We can also
anticipate that ANOVA test will assume AED locations and traffic
intersections are same across all five boroughs. Overall, we will
prioritize efficient code and clear documentation to ensure
reproducibility. \## Planned Timeline

Nov 7: Submit Proposal Nov 10-14: Finalize with teaching team Nov 17-21:
Start data cleaning, meet with team to delegate parts of data cleaning
Nov 24-28: Create website. Delegate planned analysis/visualizations and
3 final deliverables. Start working on them and aim to finalize first
draft by end of week. Dec 1-5: Finalize visualizations, website,
deliverables and report for submission. Record the screencast and upload
on website Dec 6: Submit website, deliverables, screecast & report by
Dec 6 at 11:59 pm. Finish peer assessment by Dec 6 at 11:59 pm.
