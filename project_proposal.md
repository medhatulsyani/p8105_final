## Project Title

AED Accessibility and Traffic Congestion in New York City

## Motivation for the project

Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are commonly used in
combination with CPR to create what the American Heart Association
describes as the “Chain of Survival” in individuals undergoing sudden
cardiac arrest (Page, 2011). Although AED accessibility is an integral
part of increasing the chances of survival, the constant traffic
congestion in New York City creates a disadvantage for residents with
the time it takes healthcare workers to travel to the scene.

Our motivation for this project is to understand how AED accessibility
corresponds with traffic congestion in New York City. Through a
combination of data on AED locations, traffic volume, and cardiovascular
disease, we hope to identify potential gaps in AED coverage in
high-traffic areas. Additionally, it may useful to analyze current data
to understand how the recently introduced congestion pricing may affect
AED accessibility/EMS response, and to examine differences between
traffic volume pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and post-pandemic and
how this corresponds with AED accessibility.
