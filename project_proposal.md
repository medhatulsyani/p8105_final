## Project Title

AED Accessibility and Traffic Congestion in New York City

## Motivation for the project

Automated External Defibrillators are commonly used in combination with
CPR to create what the American Heart Association describes as the
“Chain of Survival” in individuals undergoing sudden cardiac arrest
(Page, 2011). Although AED accessibility is an integral part of
increasing the chances of survival, the constant traffic congestion in
New York City creates a disadvantage for residents with the time it
takes healthcare workers to travel to the scene.
