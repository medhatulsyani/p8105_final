## Project Title

AED Accessibility and Traffic Congestion in New York City

## Motivation for the project

## Planned analyses/visualizations

### 1. EDA

- AED distribution and density across boroughs and years using
  visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and line plots
  - Map AED distribution using leaflet and sf
- Traffic volume trends across boroughs and years using visualizations
  like boxplots and line plots
  - Mean and median for traffic volume across borough and year

### 2. Inferential Analysis

- ANOVA to compare mean AED density and mean traffic volume across
  boroughs
- Correlation to assess the relationship between AED density and mean
  traffic volume using Pearson’s correlation coefficient

Derived Metric: Calculate the Traffic Burden Ratio (TBR) = total traffic
volume ÷ total AED count per borough. Use TBR to highlight boroughs with
high congestion and low AED coverage.

### 3. Dashboard

Further visualization where we will develop a flexdashboard that
contains:

- Borough-level AED map
- Traffic trends and summary plots
- AED–traffic comparison charts
