Our project explores how the placement of **Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs)** aligns with the traffic trends of one of the world’s busiest cities.Through a combination of data on AED locations, traffic volume, and cardiovascular disease, we will identify potential gaps in AED coverage in high-risk and high-traffic areas.

### **Dashboard and Maps**

Check out Dashboard and Maps above for AED Coverage & Traffic Volume Maps. The maps display AED locations and average traffic volumes captured between 2019 to 2024 across NYC boroughs. 
You can play around with the AED and traffic data in our interactive map to explore:

* AED locations
* AED counts
* AED trained personnel
* total traffic count
* average traffic volume
